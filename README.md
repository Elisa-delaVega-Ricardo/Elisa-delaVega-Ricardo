- 🔭 I’m in the final stretch of completing my Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Virginia, where I’ve immersed myself in advanced topics like deep learning, Bayesian inference, and scalable data engineering. Over the past three semesters I’ve:
- Designed and deployed neural networks in PyTorch and TensorFlow for real-world image and text tasks  
- Built end-to-end data pipelines with Docker and Airflow, handling datasets from ingestion to visualization  
- Applied statistical and probabilistic modeling (Stan, ADVI) to answer complex, policy-relevant questions  
- Collaborated with my team FACEMINE on a project—developing Enhacing Remote Therapy with Facial Expression Recognition, a real-time facial emotion recognition app for telehealth  

I expect to graduate in August 2025, armed not just with theory but hands-on experience in productionizing models, orchestrating cloud workflows, and translating data insights into actionable impact. Let’s connect if you’re passionate about computer vision, healthcare AI, or robust data architectures!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning 🐍 Python Core Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib / Seaborn, and Plotly. 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost, TensorFlow / Keras, PyTorch.

- 👯 Data science has the power to change lives, and I’m looking to team up with fellow builders, researchers, and dreamers who want to tackle some of humanity’s toughest challenges. Whether you’re working on a non-profit’s analytics platform or an open-source climate model, I’m all in.

**Areas I’m passionate about:**
- 🌍 **Global Health & Equity**  
  Developing predictive models for disease outbreaks, optimizing resource allocation in underserved communities, and personalizing treatment recommendations.  
- 🌱 **Climate & Sustainability**  
  Building time-series forecasts for air quality and weather patterns, designing algorithms to optimize renewable energy use, and enabling smarter conservation efforts.  
- 🤖 **Ethical & Inclusive AI**  
  Ensuring fairness in ML pipelines, demystifying bias in datasets, and creating transparent, explainable models that everyone can trust.  
- 🎓 **Education & Social Impact**  
  Crafting adaptive learning systems, analyzing large-scale survey data to improve policy decisions, and leveraging NLP to make knowledge more accessible.

**How we can work together:**
- 🎯 **Open Source Projects:** I’m happy to jump into GitHub issues, write new modules, or help with documentation.  
- 🚀 **Research & Grants:** Interested in co-authoring papers or applying for funding? Let’s brainstorm proposals.  
- 🛠️ **Hackathons & Workshops:** I love teaming up for weekend sprints, meetups, or virtual datathons.  
- 💬 **Just Chat:** Sometimes the best collaborations start with a coffee (virtual or in-person). Hit me up on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/elisa-delavega-ricardo) or open an issue on one of my repos!

If this resonates, let’s connect and turn big ideas into real-world impact!    

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with designing end-to-end MLOps pipelines—think Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions—to streamline model deployment, monitoring, and versioning.  
- 💬 Ask me about Bayesian inference in Stan (ADVI vs. HMC diagnostics), building real-time emotion-recognition models in PyTorch + OpenCV, or crafting tidyverse workflows in R.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/elisa-delavega-ricardo)  | ✉️ elisa.delavegaricardo@richmond.edu | elisadelavegaricardo@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact:  I’ve lived in three different countries, speak fluent Spanish, and survived a communist dictatorship!
